# Project 2 Evaluation

[inline code comments](https://github.com/nrc0004/project2/pull/1/files)

## Technical Requirements
**3: Excelling**
> The app contains 3 models and implements user authentication, which goes beyond the technical requirements. Two models are full CRUD.

## Creativity and Interface
**3: Excelling**
> This app is stunning! One of the best interfaces we've seen from this batch of projects. Clearly you spent a good amount of time on this.

## Code Quality
**2: Performing**
> Code is well-formatted, well-named, and contains few style / quality issues

## Deployment and Functionality
**3: Excelling**
> Application was successfully deployed.

## Planning / Process / Submission
**1: Progressing**
> App is submitted, with basic evidence of planning. Documentation exists, but lacks common areas such as setup instructions, description of application functionality. Definitely update with installation instructions so that employers' will know how to set up your app. That is, running bundle install, setting up the database, etc. Also, talk about what your app does.
